Instructions to use commands that are supported by our application:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have modified our driver class 'ImageManipulator.claas' to determine the program's view based on
three command-line inputs as follows:

1.If the command "java -jar Program.jar -file path-of-script-file" is used, the program opens the
specified script file, executes it, and then closes.
Example: java -jar IMEProject.jar -file script.txt

2.If the command "java -jar Program.jar -text" is used, the program opens in an interactive text
mode, allowing the user to type the script and execute it line by line.
Example: java -jar IMEProject.jar -text

3. If the command "java -jar Program.jar" is used or if the jar file is double-clicked, the program
opens in the graphical user interface mode.
Example: java -jar IMEProject.jar

Operations supported in GUI:
---------------------------------

* Load image: Load an image by clicking on 'Load Image' button on top and then select the desired
              file from the file explorer popped up in dialog box and then click open on the
              bottom of dialog box.

* Save image: Save the image with the desired name and extension at desired filepath by selecting
              in file explorer from the file explorer popped up in dialog box and then click save
              on the bottom of dialog box.

* Greyscale image on Component: Convert an image to grey-scaled on desired component.To do this
                                first load a image (if not loaded )or continue on loaded image if
                                already loaded.Click on grey-scale button located at the bottom of
                                the window .On clicking a dialog box pops up asking you to select
                                an option from 6 radio buttons.The each radio button is for each
                                component on which the greyscale image needs to be generated.The
                                six options are red-component, green -component , blue- component ,
                                luma-component, Intensity-component and Value-component.After
                                selecting a component we need to press ok button and the grey-scaled
                                 image is generated.

                                      brightening must happen.This number can be positive or
                                      negative.

                   blue components respectively.To do this first load a image (if not loaded )or
                   continue on loaded image if already loaded.Click on 'RGBSplit' button located at
                    the bottom of the window.On clicking a dialog box pops up giving you the option
                    of saving red, green and blue images which are produced after performing
                    rgb-split respectively.

* Rgb-combine image: Combine the three greyscale images into a single image that gets its red,green
                     and blue components from the three images respectively. To do this first load
                     a image (if not loaded )or continue on loaded image if already loaded.Click on
                     'RGBCombine' button located at the bottom of the window.On clicking a dialog
                     box pops up giving you the option of loading red, green and blue images which
                     are needed to combine.
